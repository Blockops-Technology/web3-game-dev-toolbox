# Web3 Game Dev Toolbox

## Abstract
In order to make web3 gaming fun we need to onboard more web2 gaming dev and studios. In order to do so, **Web3 Game Dev Toolbox** offers platform and SDK any web2 developer can use and add web3 component into web2 game without the need of learning web3 or Solidity.

### This project consists from 4 components:

1. Gaming Assets Smart Contract (folder name: gamin-assets-contracts)
2. Web app for creating projects and NFT-izing gaming assets (folder name: demo-dashboard)
3. Backend for storing project data (folder name: simple server)<br/>**Note: simple server was generated by ChatGPT in order to save time*
4. Gaming SDK to easily integrate web3 component directly into game (folder name: sdk)

## NOTE:
This project is created during 36 hour long hackathon (ETHGlobal Lisbon) by *quick and dirty just make it work method*. There are many bug and many things should be refactored according to good practice and industry standards.
